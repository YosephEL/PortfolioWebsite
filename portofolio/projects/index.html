					<h3>Do you believe that they unfairly threaten the sovereignty of certain nations?</h3>
				<h5>I read six goals of World Bank and IMF I think they work together, in short description; making Monetary policy, Liberalization, stability on Exchanging rate, assisting on Multilateral System, Safeguard to members for the payment crises, and Balance payment of a member.[1]

<br>What I believe as globalization growing together and financial policy have more advantage for developing countries and as well for developed countries, I consider myself like using the technology to make a globalization. The high political power country or a large shareholders members of the IMF or World Bank like the United States or the other country have the power to give fund or not. So they try to push the ideology or some of their own interest or some policy into the sovereignty of certain nations. That is okay, I respect the reply because the money and the fund they have, I think that has been given and be used for the society,  maybe it is from 'direct tax', the government contributes from the direct tax mean form the society so it should be on the good and appropriate purpose. But on the humanitarian help, it should not be threatened as a normal base, I did not agree to put agreement or criteria to get a fund for humanitarian activities. And I don't believe the unfair threats on the sovereignty of certain nation for the society of the humanitarian practices, they shouldn't consider it as a fund. The should not make a law or threaten practice. </h5>

					<h3>The impact it is having on moving us toward a more globalized system</h3>
					<h5>I have chosen the technological advancement to address how the world system society and activity has been globalized through using this technology. I would like to write podcasting technology, and how this podcasting technology activity is effective and succeeds and seeing in the whole world. A podcast is episodic is a series activities in audio or video files, the user can download from internet and listen to it. It is often available for listening when the user is online and getting updates from it. The new episodes are automatically available to download through web technology, The users can access the file through a local computer, mobile application, or portable media applications. 
<br>
I have used the media technology advancement because of the reason that I saw a big change. I have used for the last five years, and I would like to show how the world has been changed and still changing through this technology advancements. This social communication and information it became a very real-time, what is happening in one place can get by other places, the other side people can follow or get it so quickly. The social media technology has improved it this. The news, journal, media sectors are coming into a live podcast in an efficient and very cost-effective ways. The impacts of this technology have had more and more contribution for moving us toward the globalized system. 
<br>
What are the benefits of this? From the Journal and Media perspective; Journals, news, letter, and magazine, radio and TV, and letters are few method to reach to the society on political, social and economic activities. With all these methods people can able to stay keep in touch, update sparing time one another, finding funny or entertaining content, the audience also sharing ideas and sharing opinion activity with others, in general, it is a network to be globalized.
<br>
From Business and education side; books, library resources, business activities and running staffs are some essential things in social economic and education activities. Using the podcast technology people can easily get it anytime. The benefits of all these in very updated and current or newer versions it would be a just garbage collections. For all these media podcasting technologies has many benefits in many directions.  people can get it anytime anywhere at any conditions, this makes the media very close to the society and more near. 
<br>The potential negative impacts are being very dependant on web technology, and the censorship can easily remove or block it, the social will not get it if the internet technology does not exist or cut off from the country. Podcast tube for the society might not be allowed to visible in some country, like China or Rasia, or some dictator country web podcast couldn't work properly[1]. 

What needs to be done in order to prevent the negative impacts, The best method is changing the society with education, social and cultural diversities. "Information is free and for everyone" is one of the good thought and everyone should agree in this. We need to do more on social development activities.

					<h3>Negative consequence of globalization. <h3>
					<h5>As I described here what I do believe some negative consequences, that happened before like, economic social and health problems due to the globalization. The problems are still existing as a global problem, If we take climate change as an example for the last 40 years is the issue. 
<br>
As we read from the Globalization101 there are many positive benefits exists because of the globalization, I am not a single person I got a benefit from globalization. My education is a good example for me to show the benefit of it. The consequence would all so be a positive. When we so the other issue climate change is top issue, renewable energy, are the top issues, Economy, The terrorism, activities are the other issue, what I believe all those problems will not over but after few years will not be a big global issue, I do believe fighting in terrorism would not be lead us to positive impact, we shouldn’t forget one thing challenge will never ends, while we address one top problem that caused  by globalization, it has its own consequences, like Syria war, refugees issue,  anti-terrorism, the consequence, mass destruction all  those  will take the world into nasty hard experience. I do believe we should fight all these global problems in many ways the first way is using education, not only using weapons but also brainwashing and fighting with a good idea.
<br>
My belief the immigrant, refugees and terrorism issue is so problematic in depth and the world cannot resolve it easily, it is not controllable, let us see why this happened this happened because of the globalization, when we see Arabic Spring, in Tunisia, the social media make this to be wider in the country and it continued up to Egypt Libya, Syria and other Arabic countries, after all the refugees and immigration became big and bit issue, The beginning of terrorist attack in 9/11 New York attack, the whole world started to talk about the terrorist issue. Still now,  the whole world couldn’t control it. The problem is so complicated and is the consequence would be worst if the only one or two countries are started to fight against terrorism, we can imagine what problems will occur in that country.
<br>
The reason why the world couldn’t resolve this problem is not known. I suppose The first reason is the terrorist are hiding and covering themselves under the civilians, The did not state in one place, on the other issue few countries, UN, US, UK or EU could never control by themselves. </h5>
